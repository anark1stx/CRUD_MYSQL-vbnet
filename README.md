# CRUD_MYSQL-vbnet
Base for my final project :)

This project contains everything from VB.NET desgin, modules and Functions to properly manipulate the database made with MySQL. This database is going to be filled with a web scrapper (already working), atm I'm working on converting the url-images of ebay into blobs to insert them in the db.
